[Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) is an online spreadsheet that allows you to create and format spreadsheets. It facilitates multiple users to work on the same spreadsheets simultaneously. It allows you to manage spreadsheets, manage worksheets, read, write, update, and clear data from worksheets. The API also allows you to perform column-wise, row-wise, and cell-wise operations.

The Google Sheets [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) connector exposes the [Google Sheets API v4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) through Ballerina. The connector makes it convenient to implement some of the most common use cases of Google Spreadsheets. With this connector, you can programmatically manage spreadsheets, manage worksheets, perform CRUD operations on worksheets, and perform column-level, row-level, and cell-level operations. 

The Google Sheets [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) listener allows you to listen to Google Sheets events. It listens to events triggered when a spreadsheet is edited. For example, when a row is appended, when a row is updated, etc.
